InstaLikeApp
============
Summary: a read-only photo viewer for Instagram which allows a user to check out popular photos. 

To complete project I used:
* Instagram APIs for data retreival
* Android Async HTTP client for making async calls (http://loopj.com/android-async-http/)
* Picasso (http://square.github.io/picasso/) to download and display the images 

Stories
* Scroll through popular photos
* Display details: Image, caption, username
* Additional detail: relative time stamp, like count, user profile image
* Add pull-to-refresh on stream
* Show latest 2 comments
* Display photo with same proportions and style as instagram
* Circular View of the profile Images
* Display a default placeholder graphic for each image during loading
